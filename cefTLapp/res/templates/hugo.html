            Machine translation, or MT, allows you to translate words, phrases, and even entire documents with the click of a button.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            The technology helps give readers a general sense of a text’s content. MT is ideally suited for tasks like technical translation, data analysis, media monitoring, and market research.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            MT systems can also be customized for a particular company or organization, taking into account its specific terminology and style. Systems can then be integrated into an organization’s platforms and applications.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            By promoting multilingual communication, MT bridges language barriers between nations, cultures, and people.
